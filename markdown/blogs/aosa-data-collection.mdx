## Data Collection

The data collection process for the Afan Oromo Audio Sentiment Analysis (AOASA) research involved multiple steps to ensure a comprehensive and diverse dataset. Here are the key aspects of the data collection:

## Sources of Data

- Social Media: Audio clips from platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and YouTube were gathered. These sources provided a wide range of informal and conversational audio data.
- Radio Broadcasts: News segments, talk shows, and interviews from local radio stations were included. These sources offered more formal and structured speech samples.
- Conversational Speech: Recordings of natural conversations between native speakers were collected. This type of data helped capture the nuances and variability of everyday spoken Afan Oromo.

## Data Annotation

The collected audio recordings were annotated for sentiment by a team of native Afan Oromo speakers. Each clip was labeled with one of the following sentiments:

- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

## Tools and Techniques

1. Speech-to-Text Conversion: The audio data was transcribed using speech-to-text algorithms that were trained specifically for the Afan Oromo language. This step converted spoken words into text, which is essential for subsequent analysis.
2. Manual Annotation: Native speakers manually annotated the transcriptions to ensure the accuracy of sentiment labels.
3. Automated Annotation: In addition to manual annotation, automated tools were used to pre-label some of the data. These labels were then reviewed and corrected by human annotators to improve efficiency.

## Challenges

- Language Specificity: Afan Oromo is a low-resource language, meaning there are limited tools and datasets available for processing it. Custom models and techniques had to be developed.
- Dialect Variations: Afan Oromo has several dialects, which can affect the pronunciation and meaning of words. Ensuring the dataset represented these variations was crucial.
  Q- uality of Audio: Background noise, recording quality, and speaker variability posed challenges for accurate transcription and annotation.

## Data Augmentation

To enhance the dataset, data augmentation techniques such as adding background noise, altering pitch, and varying speed were applied. This helped create a more robust dataset capable of handling real-world variations.

## Summary

The data collection process for AOASA involved sourcing diverse audio recordings, accurate transcription and annotation, and addressing challenges specific to Afan Oromo. This comprehensive dataset formed the foundation for developing and evaluating the sentiment analysis models.

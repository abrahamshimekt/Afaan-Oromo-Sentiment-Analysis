## Introduction

The Afan Oromo Audio Sentiment Analysis (AOASA) research paper presents a comprehensive study on the development and implementation of a sentiment analysis system for the Afan Oromo language using audio data.
This research addresses the unique challenges of analyzing sentiment in a low-resource language and proposes novel techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The data collection process involved gathering a diverse set of audio recordings in the Afan Oromo language.
These recordings were sourced from various domains, including social media, radio broadcasts, and conversational speech. The data was then annotated for sentiment using a combination of manual and automated methods.

### Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps included noise reduction, normalization, and segmentation of the audio files. The audio data was converted into text using speech-to-text algorithms specifically trained for Afan Oromo. This textual data was then tokenized and cleaned to remove any extraneous noise.

### Sentiment Analysis Model

We employed a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop the sentiment analysis model. Initially, traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes were used as baselines. Subsequently, more advanced deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were implemented to improve sentiment prediction accuracy.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the sentiment analysis models was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a cross-validation approach was used to ensure the robustness of the results.

## Results

The results of the sentiment analysis models showed significant improvements over the baseline models. The deep learning models, particularly the RNN and CNN, demonstrated higher accuracy and better generalization to unseen data. The detailed results and comparison with existing models are presented in the results section.

## Conclusion

The AOASA project successfully developed a sentiment analysis system for Afan Oromo audio data. The use of advanced deep learning techniques proved to be effective in handling the complexities of sentiment analysis in a low-resource language. This research provides a foundation for future studies and applications in sentiment analysis for Afan Oromo and other similar language
